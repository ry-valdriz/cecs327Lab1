Project1: notes and submission guideline
***********************************************************************
Instruction:
1- Project/Home work folder structure
   Project folder contains three subfolders
   1-1 Example folder 
       This is a sample code for how to utilize Utilities in your code.
       Utilites is an I/O tool that you will be needed to do 
       your project. All students should use Utilies APIs in their code 
       for any I/O interaction. This helps me to run your code with the 
       same input file uniformly.  
 	 		
   1-2 Project1 folder
       Your project files goes under this folder.

   1-3 Utilities folder
       IO tools written by Dr. Duncan Buell from University of South 
       Carolina and maintain by me!

Running the example:
1- On you linux machine cd to the direcory from your terminal
2- Issue command make
   This will create an executable that is called Aprog
3- Run the program by issuing ./Aprog

Project/Homework1
1- This assignment needs two 3 by 3 matrixes as inputs.
   Two series of inputs are given to you in this folder. Your code 
   should produce the same output for given inputs. These are minimum 
   testing, I may use other inputs as well.
   
2- This folder contains a make file, modify this based on your files and 
   need. I will not run your code manually. A script will call your make 
   file and this is your responsibility to make sure your project compiles
   properly (I will not fix your glitches in make file for example)   
    
3- Your executable must be called Aprog and please do not change this 
   name in the make file.
   Once again a script will run the initial compiling so if you change 
   Aprog name, the script will not recognize it.

4- To submit your code please make a single tar.gz file from entire project1
   folder. To create a tar.gz file you can issue commend below from your 
   terminal:
   tar -czvf Project1.tar.gz Project1 
   Please do not include or submit Utilities folder.
   And finally rename your tar.gz file to
   lastname1_lastname2.tar.gz (lastname1 and 2 are two group members)
   example: obama_trump.tar.gz
